## Experience

### &nbsp;&nbsp; **Amazon**

<p align="center">I work for the Amazon Retail Warranties team delivering features to customers with less than 15 ms of latency and more than four 9's of reliability.

My responsibilities included monitoring and answering questions from students, grading homework and helping guide the direction of the class. The contents taught in this class include python basics, how to use external libraries to help with data visualization ( Pandas, Numpy, D3.js ) and how to deploy python modules to public API's in order to create pleasant data visualization tools for end customers. My area of expertise in this class was machine learning, helping the proffesor and students gain an intutive insight on back propagation, Convolutional networks and common machine learning pitfalls ( Overfitting, incorrect seperation of training and test data, normalization mistakes,  )</p>
