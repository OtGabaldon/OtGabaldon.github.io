## About Me

<p align="center">
  <i>Software engineer that develops maintainable, low-latency, and scalable web solutions for a variety of consumer and business problems.</i>
</p>

I create systems that can be easily debugged and maintained by other engineers, as well as scaled and localized to a variety of marketplaces. These systems allow businesses to reliably and efficiently on-board new use cases using minimal engineering resources. My work has encompassed international product launches that utilize serverless architecture and scalable databases, providing new features to millions of customers and access to billions of data points for internal business metrics. This further allowed the business to create useful solutions using data driven decisions that maximize customer impact.

## Experience

### &nbsp;&nbsp; **Amazon**
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Software Development Engineer** | July 2019 - Present 
<p align="center">
  <i>Designs and delivers features to customers with less than 15 ms of latency and more than four 9’s of reliability.</i>
</p>
 
My time at Amazon has ranged from improving error handling and logging on large systems, to moving front-end business logic behind internal API’s, to helping design and implement customer facing tooling for Amazon product management. These projects involved working cross-team in order to provide easily expandable solutions while serving current customer needs. Teaching me how to, not only manage the needs of my own team, but also integrate the needs of the entire organization. Languages used are Javascript, Java, Python and Pearl/Mason. Frameworks include React, internal CI pipelines and AWS. 
 

### &nbsp;&nbsp; **Trilogy Education**
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Teachers Assistant** | Sept 2018 - Jan 2019 
 
<p align="center">
  <i>Assisted the Professor in educating students about data visualization in python.</i>
</p>
My responsibilities included monitoring and answering questions from students, grading homework and helping guide the direction of the class. The contents taught in this class include python basics, how to use external libraries to help with data visualization ( Pandas, Numpy, D3.js ) and how to deploy python modules to public API’s in order to create pleasant data visualization tools for end customers. My area of expertise in this class was machine learning; helping the professor and students gain an intuitive insight on back propagation, convolutional networks and common machine learning pitfalls ( Overfitting, incorrect separation of training and test data, normalization mistakes ) 


### &nbsp;&nbsp; **StratEx**
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Front End Intern** | Jun 2017 - Aug 2017

<p align="center">
  <i>Managed production code, including version control, CI pipelines, and worked with other engineers on a shared codebase.</i>
</p>

* Implemented configuration pages for business customers for our SaaS HR webapp using MVC .NET frameworks, which helped me learn the separation of business logic, data models, and rendering logic.

* Simplifying complex concepts to increase efficiency of communication regarding technical concepts to our non-technical team members.


## Education

### &nbsp;&nbsp; **University Of Central Florida**
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Computer Science** | Fall 2016 - Spring 2019
 
 * Member of white paper reading group for Machine Learning methods related to Neural Networks.
 * Improved efficiency in a sound ecology [research package](https://github.com/OtGabaldon/soundecology).
 * Helped develop the first iteration of [sound ecology tooling package](https://github.com/jonathanbeever/mangrove).

## Outside work

When I'm not working I enjoy learning about different concepts in physics, philosophy and Machine Learning. I also like to weightlift and rockclimbing. When I'm not in the gym I enjoy exploring the trails and mountains that inhabit Colorado. Always looking for my next adventure.
