# About Me

<p align="center">
  <i>Software engineer developing maintainable, low-latency, and scalable web solutions for a variety of consumer and business problems.</i>
</p>

I create systems that can be easily debugged and maintained by other engineers, as well as scaled and localized to various marketplaces. These systems enable businesses to efficiently onboard new use cases with minimal engineering resources. My work has included international product launches using serverless architecture and scalable databases, delivering new features to millions of customers and providing access to billions of data points for internal business metrics. This has empowered data-driven decisions that maximize customer impact.
